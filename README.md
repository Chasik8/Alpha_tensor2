# Alpha Tensor 2

Alpha Tensor 2 is a C++ project developed using CLion. The goal of this project is to find the fastest matrix multiplication algorithms by building a Monte Carlo tree and training a neural network to make decisions at each node.

## Features

- Efficient tensor operations
- High performance

## Requirements

- - Clionidae
- C++17 or later
- CMake
- libtorch
- oneapi-tbb

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Create a project using CMake.
3. Download the lib torch and oneapi-tbb libraries

## Usage

Include the necessary headers in your C++ files and start using the objects for learning fast matrix multiplication provided by Alpha Tensor 2.
